    <h1>OCD Treatment</h1>

    <p>
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) involves intrusive, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental rituals (compulsions) performed to reduce anxiety. These patterns can become exhausting and disruptive, but with the right treatment approach, meaningful relief is possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      OCD is not simply a preference for cleanliness or order — it is a neurologically based condition that can affect daily life, relationships, work, and emotional well-being. Common obsessions include fears of contamination, harm, or mistakes, while compulsions may include checking, cleaning, counting, seeking reassurance, or avoiding situations that trigger anxiety.
    </p>

    <p>
      Treatment often includes medication to reduce obsessive thinking and anxiety, along with evidence-based therapeutic approaches such as Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). When appropriate, I provide referrals to specialized OCD therapists to ensure you receive comprehensive, targeted care.
    </p>

    <p>
      My role is to support you with understanding, patience, and a personalized treatment plan that helps you regain control over your thoughts and actions. You are not alone — with the right tools and support, OCD can become significantly more manageable.
